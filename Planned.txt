Listed here is a set of planned updates and additions to the SELF.


Main
  [ ] The remainder of the HexMesh module will be finished, complete with a mesh face detection routine ( for hexmesh )
  [ ] 3-D DGSEM test solver will be added to the dgsem/ subdirectory
  [ ] 2-D cgsem libraries will be updated - the iterative solver will be removed from this module.
  [ ] IterativeSolvers module will be added. Data and procedural polymorphism will be implemented to carry out
      iterative solution algorithms with or without preconditioning. The only requirements of extended types of IterativeSolvers
      are MatrixAction and Residual procedures.
  [ ] EigenSolvers module will be added in a similar manner to the IterativeSolvers. This will improved readability
      and reusability. Highend module for computing topographic wave mode dispersion relation and modal structures
      will be redesigned with the new EigenSolvers module.  The only requirement of extended types of IterativeSolvers
      are MatrixAction.
  [ ] Piecewise interpolation modules will be added which make use of the mesh modules. The primary purpose of the 
      piecewise routines is to support the development of particle tracking modules (also planned).
  [ ] Particle tracking modules will be added.

Periphery

  [ ] The TimerClass will be finished. Library routines and test-programs will be copied with timing routine calls inserted.
  [ ] I am looking for anyone with familiarity with TAU or other profiling tools to help perform benchmarking studies with the
      SELF.
  [ ] Conform all modules to the same "header-format". 
  [ ] To be consistent with other OOP libraries, swap "Build" for "Initialize" and "Trash" for "Finallize"
  [ ] Determine the best method for accessor routines and when to appropriately implement data-hiding.
