\chapter{Overview and Motivation}

\chapter{QuickStart}
At this point, you have probably unpacked the \texttt{SEM} software libraries in your favorite directory. Here, this will be denoted with ``\texttt{install/dir}.'' This part of the documentation will walk you through the compilation and execution procedures for an instance of the \texttt{DGSEM\_ShallowWater\_Class}. Additionally, steps will be shown for modifying the initial conditions and the mesh to demonstrate the ability to modify the problem. More advanced modifications are discussed in Chapter \ref{chap:Class}. \\

Overall, there are three main steps to performing a simulation
\begin{enumerate}
\item Generate a mesh.
\item Generate initial conditions.
\item Integrate in time.
\end{enumerate}

The first step is achieved by using the SpecMesh software. This generates a mesh from boundary and internal curve inputs in the ``ISM-v2'' format (see the SpecMesh documentation for details on this). Initial conditions are generated using a driver program \texttt{ShallowWater\_Init.f90}. This driver reads in the mesh file output from SpecMesh, computes initial conditions specified by the user within the program, and writes an initial pickup file. Finally, the main driver \texttt{ShallowWater\_Main.f90} reads the mesh and pickup file and performs integration forward in time, manages diagnostic calculations, and file I/O.\\

We will begin by working with the ``gravity-wave'' example. Once you are within the installation directories, you should see the subdirectories
\begin{verbatim}
doc/  examples/  src/  testing/
\end{verbatim}
Change directories into \texttt{examples/} and into the subdirectory \texttt{shallowwater}.
\begin{verbatim}
cd examples/shallowwater
\end{verbatim}
As more validated experiments are conducted with the shallow-water solver, more examples will be found here. For now, we will go into the \texttt{gravity-wave} directory, underneath which you will find the subdirectories
\begin{verbatim}
build/   init/  meshgen/  run/
\end{verbatim}
In the first step, we will modify the make file to ensure we are using the correct compiler and all SEM source directory is set appropriately. The makefile is located in the \texttt{build} directory. Change directories into the \texttt{build} directory and open up the makefile in your favorite text editor. You should see something like 
\begin{verbatim}
# Specify the SEM source code directory
SRCDIR=/home/joe/Desktop/work/SEM/SEM_v2.0/src/
FC=gfortran

# Additional library and includes directories
LIB=
INC= 

# Fortran compilation flags
FFLAGS=-O3 -fopenmp
\end{verbatim}
Set the \texttt{SRCDIR} to the directory where you installed the SEM libraries and include \texttt{src/} at the end (similar to what is shown). Ensure  that the fortran compiler is set appropriately in the variable \texttt{FC}. Lastly, any optimization, debugging, or warning compilation flags should be set under \texttt{FFLAGS}.\\
